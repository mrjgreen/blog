I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience and I've recently been
spending my time designing and implementing complex, multi-tier systems for processing
terabytes of event data.

I take pride in working to high standards of quality and strive to improve on 
best-practice, to ensure that systems are robust, highly available and easy to scale.

* PHP
* Python
* Go
* C/C++
* Node
* JavaScript & Frameworks (Eg. AngularJS)
* MySQL/MariaDB
* Postgres
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services (+Terraform) 
* Provisioning (Puppet, Ansible)
* Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Concourse CI)
