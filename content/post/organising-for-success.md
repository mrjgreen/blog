> TL;DR - Having policies in place for the technical cornerstones of your organisation
can prevent "accidental anarchy" within your teams.

### Cornerstones

 * Documentation
 * Communication
 * Version Control
 * Security
 * Data
 * Application Stack
 * Infrastructure
 * Deployment
 * Logging and Monitoring


### Summary

The most important thing is to put in place the right structures for discussing, documenting, 
disseminating and iterating upon the policies you put in place.


 * Organisations start small
 * 1 or 2 people manage everything
 * "Oh it'll never be that big"
 * "It's going to be huge!"
 * "Works of Art" and "Special Snowflakes"
